# Sub-spaces

The universe that the game takes place in is composed of one or more layers. 
The layers have the potential to interact, but are not required to do so.
Layers with different cardinality (1D, 2D, 3D, etc) can intersect based on their canonical formulae.
I.E. A 2D plane can intersect with a 3D volume based on the equation d = a* x_0 + b * y_0 + c * z_0

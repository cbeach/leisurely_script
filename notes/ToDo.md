# In Progress
  - update ast
    - fix the subclass bug in the legal move definition.
      - The error is reproduced by temp.scala

# Backlog
  - refactor directory structure
  - open, run, test in IntelliJ
  - figure out how to unit test the implementations
  - write some unit tests for implementations
  - start working on "compilation"
    1. figure out what the design for the compiler is going to look like.
    2. decompose the test program into an ast
    3. decompose and render the:
      - players
      - graph 
      - pieces
      - end conditions
      - legal moves

# Completed
  - create a very simple cli interface for the ttt example implementation
    - automate it
  - implement the end conditions
  - debug the example ttt implementation
